This fork of baritone is aimed mainly for mapart.

If there are any issues that bother the original creator with this fork, I will remove it without hesitation

Changes this fork brings:

New settings:

	-prioritizeBottomBlocks: it should in theory prioritize the bottom blocks
	-costPerLevel: this is in direct connection with the prioritizeBottomBlocks, this is highly experimental, but it increses the cost per each level, shouldn't go high, go max around 6-8
	
	-buildInLayersSideways: if buildinlayers is true, this will build in layers on the x,z axis, if it's false, it will build on the y axis like it was before
	-buildInLayersSidewaysXAxis: it's in direct connection with the buildInLayersSideways setting, if this is false it will build on z axis, otherwise on the x axis
	
	-dontPlaceBlocksThatAreNotFull: this option should make baritone not place incomplete blocks(carpets, cobwebs, slabs, etc), to avoid a pesky bug(where it gets stuck in an infinite loop of placing and breaking), place them yourself, I had a fix to avoid it getting in infinite loops but it was just disgusting, I have to familiarize even more with bartione's source code to fix that, until then again place them yourself
    -mapArtMode: not new, but I changed how it works, now it will care about any blocks above the first non-air block, including the original block. Usefull if you have some blocks that need a block under them to be placed like carpets
    -homearea(or ha for short): is a cool feature, it works like sel but whatever is inside this selection will be protected from baritone, no longer it will break your walls or place blocks in the middle of your living room, now it will use the door as a normal being :P
    -safeFarming: baritone wont break or place blocks while #farm -ing
    -echest: new command, it will turn chests into obsidian, I recommend you to use this commands with some hoppers under you
